1. Put "joe-fixes" directory on same level with "instead-1.5.2"
2. Run ./prepare.sh for applying all the changes that I was made
3. If you want to apply icon patch - run ./fix-icon.sh

Usually you don't need to deal with other files in that dir,
but there is their description:

 debian/             -- directory used by script "prepare.sh".
                        This will be copied instead of original
                        (upstream) debian/ dir.
 fix-icon.sh         -- script for applying icon transparency patch
 icon-wnd.patch      -- file used by "fix-icon.sh"
 maemo-build.patch   -- file used by "prepare.sh".
                        I just fix it to correspondance with current
                        packet state
 prepare.sh          -- script for applying all the changes I was made
                        (except icon transparency fix)
 README              -- this file
 sdl_instead_wnd.png -- file used by "fix-icon.sh".
                        This is INSTEAD icon without semi-transparency
