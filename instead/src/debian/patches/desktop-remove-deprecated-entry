Description: Remove "Encoding" entry in desktop file
 Regarding Lintian rule "desktop-entry-contains-encoding-key":
 .
 The Encoding key is now deprecated by the FreeDesktop standard
 and all strings are required to be encoded in UTF-8.
 .
 This desktop entry explicitly specifies an Encoding of UTF-8,
 which is harmless but no longer necessary.
