License: CC0
 The person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work
 to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work
 worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring
 rights, to the extent allowed by law.
 .
 You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for
 commercial purposes, all without asking permission.
 .
 CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
 SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
 RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS"
 BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS
 DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS
 LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
 INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.
 .
 Statement of Purpose
 .
 The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
 exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
 subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
 authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
 .
 Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
 purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
 works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
 claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
 and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
 purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
 contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
 further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
 reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use
 and efforts of others.
 .
 For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
 of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with
 a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
 Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to
 the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of
 his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and
 intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
 .
 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
 protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
 Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
 to, the following:
 .
    i.   the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
         communicate, and translate a Work;
    ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
    iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
         likeness depicted in a Work;
    iv.  rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
         subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
    v.   rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of
         data in a Work;
    vi.  database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of
         the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the
         legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation
         thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
         directive); and
    vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
         world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
         implementations thereof.
 .
 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
 applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
 unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
 and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
 known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
 action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
 duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
 makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
 to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
 such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
 termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
 enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
 Statement of Purpose.
 .
 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
 judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
 shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
 Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
 Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
 royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
 irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
 Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
 maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
 extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
 copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
 commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License
 shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
 Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
 invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
 ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
 such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
 of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
 assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
 in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
 .
 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
 .
    a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
       surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
    b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
       warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
       statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
       title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
       infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
       the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
       the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
    c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
       that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
       limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
       Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
       consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
       Work.
    d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
       party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
       this CC0 or use of the Work.

 artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic
 adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
 transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from
 the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not
 be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the

 as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
 broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in

 their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
 included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other

 themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work
 that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
 defined above) for the purposes of this License.

 photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch
 or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
 architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
 compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable

 it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
 .
 h. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
 License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
 respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
 Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
 violation.
 .
 i. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
 and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means
 or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
 performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
 members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place
 individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any
 means or process and the communication to the public of the performances
 of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
 rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.
 .
 j. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
 without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
 fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
 protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
 medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collections;
 .
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
 Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
 steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
 were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
 marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
 modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
 in Collections; and,
 .
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not
 limited to the rights described in Section 4(e).
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
 of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
 Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
 Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
 the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the
 recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
 under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You
 must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
 disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
 Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You
 may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
 rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This
 Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
 this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
 made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
 upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
 remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(d), as
 requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor
 You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
 credit as required by Section 4(d), as requested.
 .
 b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under: (i)
 the terms of this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the
 same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
 jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
 contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
 Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 US) ("Applicable License"). You
 must include a copy of, or the URI, for Applicable License with every
 copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
 offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of
 the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
 to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
 Applicable License. You must keep intact all notices that refer to the
 Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy
 of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly
 Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may
 not impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation that
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to
 exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
 Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
 incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
 apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the
 Applicable License.
 .
 c. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3
 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward
 commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of
 the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
 otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward
 commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is
 no payment of any monetary compensation in con-nection with the exchange
 of copyrighted works.
 .
 d. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
 Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
 Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
 provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
 name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
 and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
 parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
 attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
 terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
 parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
 reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
 associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
 copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv)
 consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
 identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
 translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on
 original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
 4(d) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
 that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
 will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
 or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
 least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors.
 For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
 Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and,
 by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
 explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
 endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties,
 as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate,
 express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
 Attribution Parties.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
 i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
 which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
 right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
 granted under this License;
 .
 ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
 the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
 licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
 right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
 granted under this License if Your exercise of such rights is for a
 purpose or use which is otherwise than noncommercial as permitted under
 Section 4(c) and otherwise waives the right to collect royalties through
 any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme; and,
 .
 iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor reserves the right to
 collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
 Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
