 Escape The Toilet: Triple Flush
 .
 Quest and puzzle game, in which you need to escape from
 the toilet.
 .
 This package already contains three versions of this game.
 .
 "You don't remember how you got here. You have not really woken up.
 The only thing that you are currently able to comprehend is that
 you are in your own toilet... A key feature of the game:
 you can get out of the toilet only by yourself! And not necessary
 today. You can escape it tomorrow for example - on a fresh mind."
 .
 The game contains 3D graphics that was made in Blender and quite
 pretty tracker music and sound effects.
